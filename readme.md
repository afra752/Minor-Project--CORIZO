## ⚙️ How It Works

The app is completely **client-side**.  
No external server or database is required — all data is stored using the browser’s **Local Storage API**.

### Data Flow:
1. **User adds** a new student record using the input form.
2. The data is **stored in Local Storage** as a JSON array.
3. On each page load, data is **retrieved and displayed** automatically.
4. Users can **edit** or **delete** records, and updates are immediately reflected in Local Storage.

## 🧠 Technologies Used

| Technology | Purpose |

| **CSS3** | Styling, dark theme, and responsive design |
| **JavaScript (ES6)** | CRUD operations and Local Storage handling |
| **Local Storage API** | Persistent data storage on the client machine |

## 🖥️ Responsive Design

* The layout adjusts to fit screens of all sizes.
* The table and form stack vertically on smaller devices.
* All text remains readable with sufficient padding and spacing.

## 🧰 Code Explanation

### JavaScript Breakdown

* `students` array holds all student data.
* Data is synced with `localStorage` using:

  ```js
  localStorage.setItem("students", JSON.stringify(students));
  ```
* Data is loaded from Local Storage on page load:

  ```js
  let students = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("students")) || [];
  ```
* Functions:

  * `renderTable()` → Displays all students
  * `editStudent(index)` → Fills form for editing
  * `deleteStudent(index)` → Removes record
  * `form.addEventListener("submit")` → Handles both add & update operations

---

## 🌙 UI Highlights

* Elegant dark purple interface
* Glowing hover effects on buttons
* Smooth rounded corners
* Table with shaded rows on hover
* Clear visual hierarchy for readability

---

## 💡 Future Improvements

* Add **search and filter** options.
* Add **sorting** by ID, Name, or Age.
* Include **form validation** and better error handling.
* Option to **export/import data** as CSV or JSON.
* Add **animations** and **theme switcher** (light/dark mode toggle).
